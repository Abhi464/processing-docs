Processing Documentation
==========

Development of Processing 3 has started, so major changes are underway inside this repository. The build scripts for the reference, site, examples, etc. are currently broken. We're working to repair this. 

This is the official source code for the Processing reference, examples, tutorials, and [processing.org](http://processing.org) web site.

If you have found an error in the Processing reference, examples, tutorials, or website you can file it here under the ["issues" tab](https://github.com/processing/processing-docs/issues).

The [processing](https://github.com/processing/processing) repository contains the source code for Processing itself. (Please use that link to file issues regarding the Processing software.)

<!-- Thanks Ben, Casey, and all the contributors for all things Processing! -->
