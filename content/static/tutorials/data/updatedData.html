    <p>
      This tutorial picks up where the <a href="http://processing.org/learning/text/">Strings and Drawing Text</a> tutorial leaves off and examines how to use String objects as the basis for reading and writing data. We'll start by learning more sophisticated methods for manipulating Strings, searching in them, chopping them up, and joining them together.  Afterwards, we'll see how these skills allow us to use input from data sources, such as text files, web pages, xml feeds, and 3rd party APIs and take a step into the world of data visualization.

    <h3>Manipulating Strings</h3>

    <p>
		In <a href="http://processing.org/learning/text/">Strings and Drawing Text</a>, we touched on a few of the basic functions available in the Java <tt>String</tt>, such as <tt>charAt()</tt>, <tt>toUpperCase()</tt>, <tt>equals()</tt>, and <tt>length()</tt>.  These functions are documented on the Processing reference page for Strings.  Nevertheless, in order to perform some more advanced data parsing techniques, we'll need to explore some additional String manipulation functions <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/String.html">documented in the Java API</a>.
