  Since its inception in 2001, Processing has sought to bridge the traditionally divided cultures of the arts and the sciences. The mission of the Processing Foundation is to link these two cultures so they can be used within a diverse constituency, by way of developing the Processing software. For those with a tendency to think in numbers, Processing introduces a language of the visual arts through a more familiar computer science vocabulary. Likewise, the software is structured through an image-based framework, making it accessible to visual thinkers. Core computer science concepts like variables, functions, and conditionals are taught side by side with visual basics like image, shape, and color.

  The key to our philosophy is the merging between the two: we see software as a medium, or something that connects two things. We view it as a means for making, and see our role as providing a new medium to artists and users across a variety of fields. At a time when our society requires a literacy and sensitivity to media of all kinds, we see ourselves making this possible for a broad spectrum of constituencies.

  Processing serves a wide range of communities in different contexts, from the university classroom to the tinkerer’s garage, used by everyone from the professional to the hobbyist. Within education at a university level, we have seen Processing leveraged as a classroom tool across disciplines as varied as computer science, English, art, architecture, design, and the digital humanities. In the last few years, it has begun to become a presence in high school and middle school classrooms, being particularly effective when used to teach science, math, and more generally, computer science. For example, the Kahn Academy now uses Processing’s tutorials and language in their beginning computer science instruction. In areas of professional development, Processing has become enfolded into the practices of interface and communication designers, artists and media artists, photographers, architects, and filmmakers. It also has a substantial role in the communities of makers and amateurs, and among hackerspaces and gatherings of hobbyists.

  The growing use of Processing in the classroom over the last twelve years has pointed toward a direction to rethink the way students are taught to program. Instead of learning a specific vocational skill (such as any one certain programming language or software), the teaching of Processing follows from a philosophy that advocates for a more generalized and strategic way of thinking. Because technology changes at such a rapid pace, the goal of any education in software has to teach the fundamentals of programming. With knowledge of such a foundation, a student is able to learn any other piece of software. Processing was specifically designed to relate to other languages, so a working knowledge of it means that a student can become well-versed in others that are more domain-specific, in relatively little time. Also, it uses a visual framework, so as to be more accessible to people who don’t naturally think like mathematicians or computer scientists. This has opened the door for software to become part of an artist’s toolkit in a way never before seen.

  The use of Processing within the visual arts and design fields has grown continuously since the software was first released. Appearing at a critical moment when artists began introducing new media and technology into their practices, Processing has allowed for thousands of creative professionals to leverage it as a medium, changing the landscape of the arts at the beginning of the 21st century. Software is still a nascent medium for artists and designers, and part of The Processing Foundation’s mission is to nurture this trajectory to be both widely used and accepted.

  Within technology, Processing has made it possible to understand massive data sets in a visual and more accessible way. It has also helped foster the connection between engineering and visual design that has been pushed to the fore by Apple and others.
