<h4>Ben Fry</h4>
            
		<p>
  Ben Fry (President) is principal of Fathom, a design and software consultancy located in Boston. He received his doctoral degree from the Aesthetics + Computation Group at the MIT Media Laboratory, where his research focused on combining fields such as computer science, statistics, graphic design, and data visualization as a means for understanding information. After completing his thesis, he spent time developing tools for visualization of genetic data as a postdoc with Eric Lander at the Eli & Edythe L. Broad Institute of MIT & Harvard. During the 2006-2007 school year, Ben was the Nierenberg Chair of Design for the Carnegie Mellon School of Design. In 2011, he won the National Design Award for Interaction Design from the Cooper-Hewitt. With Casey Reas, Fry initiated Processing in 2001, an open source programming language and environment created for visual artists.

<h4>Daniel Shiffman</h4>

        <p>
  Daniel Shiffman (Treasurer) works as an Associate Arts Professor at the Interactive Telecommunications Program at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts. Originally from Baltimore, Daniel received a BA in Mathematics and Philosophy from Yale University and a Master's Degree from the Interactive Telecommunications Program. He works on developing tutorials, examples, and libraries for Processing, the open source programming language and environment created by Casey Reas and Ben Fry. He is the author of Learning Processing: A Beginner's Guide to Programming Images, Animation, and Interaction and The Nature of Code (self-published via Kickstarter), an open source book about simulating natural phenomenon in Processing.

<h4>John Maeda</h4>

        <p>
 John Maeda (Advisor) is currently a Design Partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. He was the President of the Rhode Island School of Design from 2008 to 2013, is a recipient of the National Design Award, and is represented in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art. Beginning in 1996, lasting for 13 years, he was a Professor at MIT, where he served as an Associate Director of Research at the MIT Media Lab and was responsible for managing research relationships with 70+ industrial organizations. He received a Ph.D. in Design Science from the University of Tsukuba Institute of Art and Design in Japan. In May 2003, he received an Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from the Maryland Institute of Contemporary Art. He received an MBA from Arizona State University in May 2006.

        <p>
  The Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) at New York University sponsored a Processing 2.0 development workshop in the summer of 2011.

		</p>
            
        <p>
  The Armstrong Institute for Interactive Media Studies at Miami University funded The Oxford Project, a series of Processing development workshops during the 2008-2009 academic year. These four-day meetings in Oxford, Ohio, enabled the November 2008 launch of Processing 1.0 and stimulated future development.

        <p>
  Oblong Industries funded Ben Fry to develop Processing during the summer of 2008. This funding also assisted in the completion of the 1.0 release. The Rockefeller Foundation awarded Ben Fry with a Media Arts Fellowship in 2006. The grant marked the first time that Ben was able to work on Processing as a funded project. This support led to further developments of the OpenGL and PDF rendering engines, as well as significant enhancements to other libraries and their integration.

        <p>
  The Interaction Design Institute Ivrea funded four individuals' work on Processing in the summer of 2003. This resulted in Dan Mosedale's preprocessor using Antlr, Sami Arola's contributions to the graphics engine, and other contributions to the Processing Development Environment and 2D graphics engine. We are grateful to Interaction Ivrea director Gillian Crampton Smith for her encouragement and support.
