					</ul>
				<li>Processing Fellows</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Lauren McCarthy, exploratory research led to <a href="https://github.com/lmccart/p5.js">p5.js</a></li>
						<li>Greg Borenstein, released <a href="https://github.com/atduskgreg/opencv-processing">OpenCV library</a></li>
						<li>Wilm Thoben, work started on new core Sound library</li>

						<li>2.0 Processing Forum launched and 1.0 Forum archived</li>
						<li>Website redesigned with simplified navigation and new tutorials</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Google Summer of Code 2013. For the third year, we mentored a group of university students to explore their ideas for extended Processing. <a href="http://shiffman.net/2013/09/24/gsoc/">Please read our summary post.</a></li>
