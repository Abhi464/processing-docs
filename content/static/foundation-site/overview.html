    The Processing Foundation was founded in 2012 with the two-fold mission to promote software literacy within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology-related fields. Our primary goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program, so as to facilitate a sophisticated way of thinking about and creating media at a time when such knowledge is crucial. We do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes <a href="https://www.processing.org/">Processing</a> (Java), <a href="http://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> (Javascript), and <a href="https://github.com/jdf/processing.py">Processing.py</a> (Python).
</p>

<p style="width: 656;">
We serve a growing community of artists, designers, educators, programmers, engineers, and anyone in between who has an inclination toward both the arts and technology. Core to our belief is that learning how to program is a process of learning how to think, rather than acquiring a certain skillset, so that this knowledge may be applied to any number of fields, from creating artworks to imagining new technologies. We view Processing as a means to bridge seemingly disparate disciplines, providing platforms for collaboration between communities that might not otherwise have had access to each other. We also envision Processing as a new tool for both artists and technologists to use in their work, as a medium and as a context. We see ourselves situated at the place of convergence between the arts and technology, facilitating the pursuit and literacy of both.

Processing is primarily developed by a dedicated group affiliated with <a href="http://fathom.info/">Fathom Information Design</a> (Boston), <a href="http://software.arts.ucla.edu/">the UCLA Arts Software Studio</a> (Los Angeles), and <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/">ITP at NYU</a> (New York City).

    The Processing Foundation supports a <a href="link">fellowship program</a> to initiate and develop research projects for the Processing software.
