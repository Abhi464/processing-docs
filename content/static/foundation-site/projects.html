		Processing was initially released with a Java-based syntax, and with a lexicon of graphical primitives that took inspiration from OpenGL, Postscript, Design by Numbers, and other sources. With the gradual addition of alternative programming interfaces&mdash;including JavaScript and Python&mdash;it has become increasingly clear that Processing is not a single language, but rather, an arts-oriented approach to learning, teaching, and making things with code.

<p>
Processing is a programming language, development environment, and online community. Founded in 2001, Processing was initially created to serve as a software sketchbook and to teach computer programming fundamentals within a visual context. Processing has since evolved into a development tool for professionals, an educational tool used in classrooms around the country, and a new context and medium for artists. Today, there are tens of thousands of students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who use Processing for learning, prototyping, and production.
</p>

<p>
It was designed to be a userâ€™s first programming language, inspired by earlier languages like BASIC and Logo, as well as our experiences as students and teaching visual arts foundation curricula. It is now used in classrooms worldwide, often in art schools and visual arts programs in universities, but also in high schools, computer science programs, and humanities curricula.

</p>

<p>
In addition to educational purposes, the Processing software is used by thousands of visual designers, artists, and architects to create their works. Projects created with Processing have been featured at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, and many other prominent venues. Processing is used to create projected stage designs for dance and music performances; to generate images for music videos and film; to export images for posters, magazines, and books; and to create interactive installations in galleries, in museums, and on the street.

<p>
p5.js is a JavaScript library that starts with the original goal of Processing&mdash;to make coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners&mdash;and reinterprets this for today's web. Using the original metaphor of a software sketchbook, p5.js has a full set of drawing functionality for the entire browser page. For this, p5.js has addon libraries that streamline interaction with other HTML5 objects, including text, input, video, webcam, and sound.
</p>

<p>
Having just been released, p5.js is in active development, with an official editing environment and other features coming soon.

<p>
Write Processing code. In Python. We are thrilled to make available this public release of the Python Mode for Processing, and its associated documentation. More is on the way!
