			Individuals making $5 to $100 donations are the largest source of income for the Processing Foundation. We’re grateful to all who have donated and we’re proud to be supported by the community. You can donate when you download the software <a href="https://processing.org/download/">here</a>.

			<b>The University of Denver</b> and the <a href="http://www.du.edu/ahss/edp/">Emergent Digital Practices</a> program sponsored a Processing 3.0 development meeting in November 2014. We thank Chris Coleman and Laleh Mehran for arranging this session and gracefully hosting us.
		</p>

		<p>
			The <b>Google Summer of Code</b> program has provided and excellent source of energy and new development through supporting students to work with us. This program has now supported Processing for four years, 2010 to 2014. It has provided the base for many important enhancements to the software.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			In 2013, <b>O'Reilly Media</b> and <b>Arduino</b> made donations to the Processing Foundation.
		</p>

		<p>
			Prior to incorporating as a Foundation, Processing received key funding and support from several organizations and companies. These commitments enabled a series of pivotal improvements to the software:
		</p>

		<ul>

        <li>
  			<a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/">The Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP)</a> at New York University sponsored a Processing 2.0 development workshop in the summer of 2011.
		</li>
            
        <li>
  			<a href="http://aims.muohio.edu/">The Armstrong Institute for Interactive Media Studies</a> at Miami University funded The Oxford Project, a series of Processing development workshops during the 2008-2009 academic year. These four-day meetings in Oxford, Ohio, enabled the November 2008 launch of Processing 1.0 and stimulated future development.
		</li>
            
        <li>
  			<a href="http://www.oblong.com/">Oblong Industries</a> funded Ben Fry to develop Processing during the summer of 2008. This funding also assisted in the completion of the 1.0 release. 
  		</li>
  		<li>
  			<b>The Rockefeller Foundation</b> awarded Ben Fry with a Media Arts Fellowship in 2006. The grant marked the first time that Ben was able to work on Processing as a funded project. This support led to further developments of the OpenGL and PDF rendering engines, as well as significant enhancements to other libraries and their integration.
		</li>
            
        <li>
  			<a href="http://interactionivrea.org/en/index.asp">The Interaction Design Institute Ivrea</a> funded four individuals' work on Processing in the summer of 2003. This resulted in Dan Mosedale's preprocessor using Antlr, Sami Arola's contributions to the graphics engine, and other contributions to the Processing Development Environment and 2D graphics engine. We are grateful to Interaction Ivrea director Gillian Crampton Smith for her encouragement and support.
