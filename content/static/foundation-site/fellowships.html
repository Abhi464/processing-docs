The Processing Foundation maintains a fellowship program that supports the development and expansion of Processing and its affiliated projects. Work done by fellows is supported through funding and mentorship from The Processing Foundation. The projects done so far have all been undertaken in parallel with each of the fellows’ practices as artists.

<b style="font-size: 1.2em;">Wilm Thoben</b> <p style="font-size:1.2em">(2013-14)</p>
<br /> 
<br /> 
Thoben developed a new core Sound library from fall 2013 through winter 2014. This library is now released with Processing 3.0. 
<br /> 
<br /> 
Wilm Thoben is a sound artist and researcher. He is currently working on his dissertation about the 1960s art and technology group E.A.T. His work deals with perception and definition of space or the abstraction of everyday life. See more of Thoben's work at <a href=”http://wilmthoben.com/”>wilmthoben.com</a>.

<b style="font-size: 1.2em;">Lauren McCarthy</b> <p style="font-size:1.2em">(2013)</p>
<br /> 
<br /> 
McCarthy started the work that has now become p5.js in spring, summer, and fall 2013. p5.js is a JavaScript interpretation of Processing. 
<br /> 
<br /> 
Lauren McCarthy is an artist and programmer based in Brooklyn, NY. She is adjunct faculty at RISD and NYU ITP, a researcher in residence at ITP, and recently a resident at Eyebeam. She holds an MFA from UCLA and a BS Computer Science and BS Art and Design from MIT. Her work explores the structures and systems of social interactions, identity, and self-representation, and the potential for technology to mediate, manipulate, and evolve these interactions. She is fascinated by the slightly uncomfortable moments when patterns are shifted, expectations are broken, and participants become aware of the system.

<br /> 
Borenstein expanded and released the OpenCV library in spring and summer 2013. 
<br /> 
<br /> 
Greg Borenstein is an artist, technologist, and teacher. He creates illusions for humans and machines. His work explores computer vision, machine learning, game design, visual effects, and drawing as media for storytelling and design. Greg is a graduate of the NYU Interactive Telecommunications Program and has worked for firms such as Makerbot and Berg London. He is the author of a book for O'Reilly about the Microsoft Kinect, titled: Making Things See: 3D vision with Kinect, Processing, Arduino, and MakerBot. He's currently a researcher in the Playful Systems Group at the MIT Media Lab. See more of Borenstein's work at <a href=”http://gregborenstein.com/”>gregborenstein.com</a>.
