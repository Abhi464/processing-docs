<b>Wilm Thoben</b> (2013-14)

<b>BIO</b> Wilm Thoben is a sound artist and researcher. He is currently working on his dissertation about the 1960s art and technology group E.A.T. His work deals with perception and definition of space or the abstraction of everyday life.

<b>PROJECT</b> Thoben developed a new core Sound library from fall 2013 through winter 2014. This library is now released with Processing 3.0.

<b>Lauren McCarthy</b> (2013)

<b>BIO</b> Lauren McCarthy is an artist and programmer based in Brooklyn, NY. She is adjunct faculty at RISD and NYU ITP, a researcher in residence at ITP, and recently a resident at Eyebeam. She holds an MFA from UCLA and a BS Computer Science and BS Art and Design from MIT. Her work explores the structures and systems of social interactions, identity, and self-representation, and the potential for technology to mediate, manipulate, and evolve these interactions. She is fascinated by the slightly uncomfortable moments when patterns are shifted, expectations are broken, and participants become aware of the system.

<b>PROJECT</b> McCarthy started the work that has now become p5.js in spring, summer, and fall 2013. p5.js is a JavaScript interpretation of Processing.
