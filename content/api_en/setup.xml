<description><![CDATA[
The <b>setup()</b> function is called once, when the program starts. It's used to define initial 
enviroment properties such as screen size and background color and to load media such as images
and fonts as the program starts. There can only be one <b>setup()</b> function for each program and 
it shouldn't be called again after its initial execution.<br />
<br />
The <b>size()</b> function must be the first line in <b>setup()</b> if the program doesn't use the <b>settings()</b> function to define the size differently. As of Processing 3.0, some things original done in <b>setup()</b> should now be defined in a new function called <b>settings()</b>. For example, if you want to define the parameters of <b>size()</b> with variables, that needs to be in <b>settings()</b>.<br />
<br />
Note: Variables declared within <b>setup()</b> are not accessible within other functions, including <b>draw()</b>.
